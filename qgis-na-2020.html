                            conference to be held on three consecutive Fridays in July (17, 24, and 31).</p>
                        <p class="lead">We offer this meeting as a way to share our ideas and skills when so many in-person meetings cannot safely happen.
                            We recognize that while we are all separated, we have the opportunity to include people in a greater diversity in
                            locations and economic situations since travel and registration costs are not necessary. We invite participation
                            from all over the globe, but presentation times will focus on the North American audience.  All sessions will be livestreamed, and links will available in the schedule below on the day of the event.</p>
                        <p class="lead">This is a free event run by volunteers.  We invite attendees to <a href="https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/donations.html" target="_blank">make a donation directly to the QGIS project</a>.</p>

                                    In addition, I would like to talk about how this tool can benefit those in mixed GIS environments, those who wish to transition to FOSS, or those consuming many government-provided data often found in these formats.
                                    Other tips, tricks, and future developments will likely be covered as well. I will be working with Nyall Dawson on the content and scope, so this is my best projection as of now. I will provide updates if it changes.</p>

                                <p class="lead">The NYS Tug Hill Commission provides technical assistance to communities within the Tug Hill Region.  We started the transition to QGIS a few years
                                    ago as our primary desktop GIS platform from other mapping products.  Through that transition we looked at other applications that would work well
                                    with QGIS and meet the needs of our organization.  We ended up hosting a centralized PostGIS database on Amazon Web Services, and having GIS Cloud
                                    be our online map viewing and mobile data collecting platform.  During this presentation you will be taken through our design thought process and
                                    the lessons we learned. This presentation could help you in your transition to QGIS and what things you may need to think about for your
                                    organization.  It will also provide you with the information that took us several years to obtain, but you can get it in this one presentation.</p>

                                <p class="lead">The Data to Policy (D2P) Project in Denver, Colorado was formed to empower students as researchers and advocates through the use of data to create
                                    more equitable communities. The Auraria Library, where I work as the Geospatial Services Specialist, has been hosting D2P for the University of
                                    Colorado Denver and Metropolitan State University Denver as spring and fall symposiums since 2017. The D2P project was inspired by the desire to
                                    create an avenue for the voices of students frustrated with police violence, but has now extended its theme to Public Data for Public Good. As
                                    the D2P student and faculty liaison, I am often introducing geospatial data, such as census data, to the participating students through QGIS.
                                    Many of these students have never heard of GIS.</p>
                                <p class="lead">Striking a balance between empowering some students with research tools and not overwhelming them with tech is a challenge. I will give some
                                    insight on how these students approach and use QGIS, for simple to more complex problems. I’ll also propose the idea of creating a bare bones
                                    GUI version of the QGIS software for making geospatial technologies accessible to non-STEM students in a way that leaves an easy path to grow
                                    into the software.</p>

                                    redistricting package for QGIS fills a significant void. Taking advantage of the capacities of QGIS 3, the new plugin offers a collection of features

                                <p class="lead">As college campuses across the US closed their doors in response to the Covid-19 crisis, students and instructors were told to shift immediately to online
                                    learning. This abrupt transition created a multitude of pedagogical challenges for classroom and laboratory learning for campuses of all types. For a small
                                    liberal arts college with an emphasis on hands-on experiential learning, the challenges were especially apparent.</p>
                                <p class="lead">This presentation will focus on the transition from lab-based instruction to remote online learning in an introductory course on GIS. From the technical issues
                                    of getting up and running remotely with QGIS to the pedagogical issues of asynchronous versus synchronous learning, the challenges and successes of the course

                                    engineering concept, to the busy, as-built track it is today?  In this talk, I will describe the how a team comprised of a geographer, hydrologist,
                                    and chemist found and georeferenced 21 historical maps of varying size, scale, and coverage from three time periods in the mid to late 1860s, then
                                    digitized the planned and built routes of the railroad to investigate just why the Central Pacific Railroad ended up where it did.  I will discuss
                                    the workflow which relied heavily on QGIS and the specific issues our team encountered working with historic railroad engineering maps.</p>

                                <p class="lead">To use a scan of a historic map as an overlay or basemap you must first georeference it, but often that is only the first step. In many cases you’ll
                                    also need to perform some image editing—to create a proper collage from a map series, or to remove the background color. In this talk I’ll share the
                                    workflow that I use to achieve these visualizations in a flexible, reusable, and fully open source way.</p>

                                <h5>Bringing Local History to Life: HistoryForge meets QGIS</h5>
                                <p class="lead speaker">Robert Kibbee, <em>The History Center in Tompkins County (Tompkins County, NY)</em></p>
                                <p class="lead">This presentation will explore the potential for using QGIS to create dynamic, engaging representations of communities in their historical setting.
                                    We will introduce the QGIS world to HistoryForge, (historyforge.net) a unique source for spatially-defined historical data, and will show and talk
                                    through how we create maps in QGIS to enhance HistoryForge’s core mission, which is to encourage every community to explore its history, encourage
                                    new historical narratives and build a sense of place. HistoryForge has used QGIS-developed maps in a variety of presentations and hopes to build a
                                    substantial gallery of cartographic interpretations of its data as part of its web environment. We will present six to eight maps developed for
                                    this session by the presenters and, we hope, some guest cartographers. We’re looking forward to discussing potential and future plans with fellow
                                    QGIS users. This presentation will also demonstrate the HistoryForge application, review the data sources and the data capture and validation
                                    procedures and  discuss data download strategies for import into QGIS. HistoryForge is an open-source web environment for exploring local history.
                                    The development model uses US Census records for Ithaca, NY, from 1900-1940, but the application is being developed and documented for any
                                    community to adopt.  Volunteer transcribers capture all available attributes from the records on the manuscript census sheets, creating a rich
                                    dataset with four distinct timeposts (the date of each decennial census). The spatially-informed data provides a strong base for working in QGIS.
                                    Every personal record is geo-addressed. In addition to records for individuals, HF also creates geo-addressed records for every building in Ithaca,
                                    documented from the census (residential buildings) and from historical maps (commercial buildings) and city directories. HistoryForge allows users
                                    to filter the datasets by multiple attributes and display the filtered results on layers of contemporary historical maps (City Engineering Maps,
                                    Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps). Most map layers are geo-rectified and constructed in Tim Waters’ MapWarper, running locally, but city ward and census
                                    enumeration district map layers are constructed in QGIS. We hope that QGIS users, particularly those involved in or supporting digital humanities
                                    programs, will come away with a new appreciation for historical data sets and the potential for bringing these to life with QGIS.</p>

                                    been able to remove the gap of financial constraints for researchers. But there is still a long way to go. QGIS Plugins to enable hydrological
                                    and hydraulic assessment are still few and far between. This hurdle needs to be removed for better accuracy in Flood mapping using QGIS. </p>

                                <p class="lead">Data collection often begins on the field. Whether in shiver or sunshine, working outdoors requires a solution that is optimized for mobile devices.
                                    QField [1] is the perfect companion of QGIS. The off-the-shelf application allows intuitive viewing and editing of data. With a slick user interface,
                                    QField allows using QGIS projects on tablets and mobiles. QField’s map display is powered by the QGIS rendering engine, so the results are identical and
                                    come with the full range of styling possibilities available on the desktop. Editing forms on QField respect the QGIS configuration and are optimised for
                                    touch interaction. For situations where network access is unavailable, a QGIS plugin downloads all the data to the device and allows integrating the changes
                                    back when returning to the office. The soon to be released QFieldCloud will make this, along with team management even simpler.</p>

                                <p class="lead">QGIS Server is a pretty young project compared to others and obviously not the most famous map server in the free world. However, it's recklessly meaningful thanks
                                    to numerous inherent qualities, especially due to its tight integration with QGIS Desktop: ease of configuration, vendor requests and parameters or even Python
                                    plugins. Moreover, the underlying implementation is more and more robust and evidenced by the OGC certification recently renewed for the LTR.</p>
                                <p class="lead">During this presentation, we're going to explore QGIS Server from a global perspective by focusing on its main features, but also talk about its drawbacks. We'll
                                    also take a quick look on the CI infrastructure, true gate-keeper of the necessary quality for an industrial application worthy of the name. And you never know,

                                <p class="lead speaker">Scott Geis and Michael Minn, <em>NYS GIS Program Office and the University of Illinois</em></p>
                                <p class="lead">Authoritative GIS data should be discoverable, understandable and easy to use by all. Furthermore, the ground floor for entry into GIS should be
                                    free and easy to access. For more than 15 years the NYS GIS Program Office (GPO) has worked to make these two objectives a reality for all New
                                    Yorkers.  However, at times, a desire to support open-source solutions can conflict with the dependence of state agencies on proprietary software.
                                    This prevented the GPO from providing a statewide, authoritative street and address point database for the open-source GIS community, until the
                                    fall of 2019 when the MMQGIS toolkit was upgraded to be able to use the ArcGIS geocoding API. This new capability, including modifications made
                                    in collaboration with GPO, made GPO's extensive address point dataset, consisting of over 6 million rooftop address points available to the
                                    open-source community through QGIS desktop software. This presentation will cover the evolution of these capabilities and the advantages these
                                    capabilities offer to New Yorkers and the open-source GIS community in general.</p>

                                <p class="lead">The combination of QGIS with spatial data bases such as Spatialite, Geopackage and PostGIS allows for creating
                                    dynamic GIS layers. A simple example for this is adding to QGIS a layer based on a database view in PostGIS (or Spatialite).
                                    Such database views can include any of the geospatial functions available in the database via their data definition (SQL) query.
                                    Adding to the complexity and flexibility of this usage such a database view can not only include references to multiple layers and
                                    include geospatial functions (such as buffers or geometry intersects) but can also include joins to custom functions allowing for very

                                    content of layers based on (the editing of) a regular database layer.</p>
